*** Technical Analysis - Intro
- Historical procies and volume data only to computer "indicators"
- Indicators are calculated from recent price and volume data to predice future price movements
- Indicators are "heruistics"

- Leverages
  - Psychology of the investor
  - "market physics"

- Tucker's iew
- Agnostic, evidence-based approach
- Bretter in the 80s-90s, market is more efficient now
- Single indicators are weak in their predictive power
- Weak predictive poser but no 'may' not be strong enough to overcome transaction costs
- Best use: when a stock's indicators are contrary to the market
- Multiple indicators together are 'better'

- If a lot of people believe in a n indicator they act on it
- giving the indicator a self fullfilling prophecy


- Technocal Analysis Explained - Martin Pring

- Wikipedia.org


"Identify a trend reversal at a relatively early stage
and ride on that trend until the wight of the evidence
shows or proves that the trend has reversed"
- Martin Pring

Assumption: "People will continue to make the smae
mistakes they have made in the past"

**** Three "Branches"
---------------
- Sentiment Indicators
  - Emotions of Investors

- Flow-of-funds Indicator
  - How mich cash has been flowing 'in' or 'out
  - What is the capacity of the market to by or sell

- Market Structure Indicators
  - Most indicators fall in this group

**** Time Scales and Trend Analysis - Tucker's opinion
 
Shorter term price movement is driven by market mechanics
Can be predicted using co-located information like order book

Longest term price movement is driven by exogenous events and insights not always
observable by computer

*** Example Indicators
- Major Theme : Underlying Value - opinion

- Assumption is that thre is a true underlying value for the asset
- Emotions and market structure cause price to deviate
- If we can estimate the underlying value, we can find argitrage opportunities
- Mean reversion


- Examples
- Google Finance
  - SMA
  - MACD
    - Moving average convergance divergance
      - Looks at two moving averages

  - Bollinger
    - Volital the bands expand
    - When calm they contract
    - When the price crosses a band that is a signal. 
      - Cross bottom is a buy
      - Cross top is a sell

- Important to convert to standard units
- Usually like to use -1.0 t0 1.0
- More convenient for degining events and for Machine Learning


- Bollinger Bands
- At top band is 1.0
- Above band is greater
- At bottom band is -1.0
- Below is greater

Indicator should adapt to volatility of the stock's price

**** How To Compute Bollinger Bands
- Read in historical closing prices
- md = "rolling" mean over look back period
- std = "rolling" STDEV over look back
- upper = mid + std
- lower = mid + std

Current "value" of Bollinger
 - if current prices at upper band = 1.0
 - if current price at lower band = -1.0
 value = (price - md/std)
