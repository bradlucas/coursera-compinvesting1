** Digging into Data
*** Digging into Data
- How to read an event sutdy
- Correct answers for $5 events
- Understsanding survivor biased dta
- Understand actual vs adjusted historical price data
- Methods of data sanity checking an scrubbing

**** Example Event
- Bollinger Bands
- Price drops below -1.5 standard deviations of recent daily values
- SPY (SP500) is above 0.25

- Event happens
- Sanity check. Drop in return per what we think
- Goes up afterwards
- Deviations grow (virtical bars)
- Number of events is low. Harder to trade

- How to trade
- Buy at event
- Hold for 7 days in this example

**** 5 Dollar Events
- Reason for the difference
- When using today's sp500 for an old event study
- You are using survivors
- You are not using companies that have died



***** Use data that is Survivor Bias free
- Includes dead and live companies

- Problems with symbols

***** Survivor Bias Data
- If you have this
- Build some random portfolios and try to beat those

*** Actual vs Adjusted Prices
Actual
The actual closing price record by the exchange on a specific date in history
Fails to account for:
- dividends
- splits

Adjusted
Price that automatcially accounts for "how much you have have made if you held the stock"

- Splits

Example: Yahoo Data: IBM
|--------------+--------+--------+--------+--------+------------+-----------|
| Date         |   Open |   High |    Low |  Close | Adj Close* | Volume    |

| Dec 03, 2012 | 190.76 | 191.30 | 188.36 | 189.48 |     189.48 | 3,349,600 |

1:4 Split
Was 300. 1 share became 4 for 75 per share


Adjusted price goes down as you go back in time

- Dividends

AGNC
Pays about 1.25 dividend each year

- Charted prices are actual prices and don't include the dividend payments

Actual prices of a stock as it approaches it's dividend
Climbs to th date of the dividend
The next day it is priced lower to ofset the dividend
Book valuel goes down by 1 dollar (example)

On the date of the dividend they adjust the price previously down to relect the dividend

**** Gaps In Data (NaN)
- missing data

Not a Number

Pandas
Fill back. Moving backward fill NaN with previous value
You can fill forward as well

Use fill forward first
Show sudden jubmps don't preak early

For the beginning if you need to fill you have to fill backward.

**** Summary
Know your data
Adjusted? or Actual?
Yahoo adjusts for splits but not dividends
Historical download has both
Important to know which

Most cases you use adjusted close
If you are look for an actual value ($5.00 event) then you need the actual value

Fill forward, then fill back
Daingers for filling forward are looking into the future

*** Data Sanity and Scrubbing
- Failure to adjust for splits properly
- Orders of magnitude drops, followed by offsetting orders of magniture climbs
  - DD 1988
- Database updates missing signifigant chunks of data/symbols

**** Why is bad data bad?
- Automated strategies may exploit bad data then fail with real data
- You think you may have discovered something

**** How to prevent

- Sanity check
- Adjusted data
- Scan new data for obvious drops or gains
- 50% drop, 200% gain
- Exact changes are usually split errors

- Log of NaNs in major stocks, Dow stocks etc. Error in data fee
- Pricess less than 0.01. Multiplier error
- NaNs > 20 trading days. Something is wrong with the stock, potential delising

- Remove or repair
- Easier and more reliable to remove

- Costly repair if you have muiltiople sources

** Quiz Preparation
- Third assignment. The Market Simulator
*** How Next Two Reviews Fit Together
Event Study > Generate Trades -> Market Simulator
Have the events create orders and then assess them in a market simulator

*** Specification for This Module's Review
- For Homework 3
- The crux of the course

- Python program
- Accept stock market orders in a csv
- Process them
- Then assess the portfolio which is created by processing these orders
- Calculate 

- Use this to test strategies

- http://wiki.quantsoftware.org/index.php?title=CompInvesti_Homework_3

- marketsim.py
- python marketsim.py 1000000 orders.csv values.csv
- use adjusted closing prices

- analyze.py
- python analyze.py values.csv \$SPX

**** Notes
***** Price per share for each symbol including column with cash per share (1.00)

- Append the '_CASH' into the price data
- df_close['_CASH'] = 1.0

|----------+-------+-------+------|
| Date\Sym |  AAPL | MSFT  | CASH |
|----------+-------+-------+------|
| 12/1     | 400.0 | 30.0  |  1.0 |
| 12/2     | 500.0 | 50.0  |  1.0 |
|----------+-------+-------+------|

***** Holdings is the number of shares of each owned at the end of the day

- Append the cash time series into the trade matrix
- df_trade['_CASH'] = ts_cash

|-------------+------+------+------|
| Date\Shares | AAPL | MSFT | CASH |
|-------------+------+------+------|
| 12/1        |   50 |  200 | 1000 |
