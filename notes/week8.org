* Week 8
** Jensen's Alpha
- Michael Jensen
- 1968

Measure should adopt to volality of the stock's price

Move from expected to actual

R = Rf + B * (Rm - Rf)

Example: SPLV versus SPV
Low volitility members of the SP500
SPLV's beta = 0.75

CAPM asserts that E(alpha) = 0
Others assert that alpha is a measure of the skill of the manager


Slope of the line is Beta
Where it intersects with the Y-axis is Alpha

** Back Tester
- Proess of testing a trading strategy on prior time periods.

- Forward testing
- Each day records which days you would have taken
- Then evaluate going forward
- Paper trading
- Takes time

- Back testing
- Quicker to validate a strategy

- Back testing is a simulation

- Roll back to an earlier point in time
- Present current information to the strategy. No future knowledge
- Ask strategy: What would you do?
- Accept ordesr, simulate their execution
- Track portfolio value
- Step forward, repeat

- Risks
- Market is different now
- Your test strategy was just "lucky"
  - This is the "data mining fallacy"
  - If you try lots of parameters (Machine Learning) you can stumble on chance soliutions that work
- Over fitting
  - The strategy is tuned to the historical data
  - It is optimized to noise or randomness, not an underlying principle
    
- Techniques
- Do initial test with a reduced data set   
  - Then test on larger to valid
  - Cross validation

- Components
  - Historical data
    - Complete, broad and survior-bias free (include dead stocks)
  - Strategy definition
    - Ease of use in defining strategies
  - Market simulator
    - Accurate simulation of transaction costs, including commisions and market impact
  - Analysis engine
    - Assess qualitative performance of the result

- Example: Market Impact
- Thinly traded stocks can be effected by your strategy
- @see paper by Almgren et al 2005
- If you are 100% of the volume of a stock for a day you will effect the price drastically

- Example: Analysis
- @see Lucena example in video
- Find reall world example

** Machine Learning Preview
- The market is a "Big Data" challenge
- 13,000 securities trading in America
- 120 technical and fundamental factors
- 252 trading days per year
- 1.96 billion data points in 5 years

- Machine Learning
- The construction and study of systems that can learn from data

- Classification: 
  - What is it?
  - Buy or sell
- Regression
  - A numerical predication

- Building a Model from Data
- The goal is to build a model
- Takes input and produces an output/action/prediction

- Model Types:

- 1. Parametric Model
- Linear
- y = mx + b
- Parameters
- Linear regression

- Polynomial
- y = mb * x^2 = m2*x + b

- 2. Data Drive
- 


Parametric Model
Pros
- Don't usually over fit
- very fast at run time
Cons
- Does nodel complete non-leinerar data well
- Sometimes over simplify

Data-Drive
Pros
- Can model completx data well
- easily adops to more data
Cons
- Sometimes slow at run time
Sometimes over fits


2D Data-Driven Model
Two dimension

K nearest neighbor

Three dimensional space
Stock, correlation, stochastic
Color for future return

Considerations
- which factors to use?
  - your insite or number crunching
- which data to use?
- how to assess models
- how to prevent over fitting

*** Quiz
The event is defined as when :

Bollinger value of equity today < -2.0
Bollinger value of equity yesterday >= -2.0
Bollinger value of SPY today >= 1.1
- Test this event using the Event Profiler over the period from 1st Jan, 2008 to 31st Dec 2009.
- Using the symbol list - SP5002012
- Using adjusted_close to create Bollinger bands
- 20 day lookback Bollinger bands

What is the number of events for the following event ?
