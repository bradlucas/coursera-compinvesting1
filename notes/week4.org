*** Where Does Information Come From?
- Nearly all quantitative-based investing is based on some kind of arbitrage model

- Remember Market Relative

- Technial Analysis
  - Price and Volume only
  - Data from the markets

- Fundamental 
  - Financial Analysis
  - P/E ratios, cash on hand, dividends
  
  - Data from SEC filings, News

*** 3 Version of Efficient Markets Hypothesis
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis
- market has all available information thereby
- price == value
**** Weak
- prices relfect all past publicaly availbel information
- prohibts profit from Technical Analysis
**** Semi-Strong
- Weak + prices instantly change to reflect new inofmration
- prohibits profit from Technical Analysis and Fundamental Analysis
**** Strong
- Semi-Strong + price instantly reflect hidden or "insider" information
- prohibits profit from insider information

- any event if too early (within 20 days or last 20 day) then not enough to it will be ignored

** Portfolio Optimization and the Efficient Frontier
- Understand "risk"
- Understand correlation and covariance
- Understand  Mean Variance Optimization
- Understand the Efficient Frontier
*** Optimization Overview
- Allocation to each equity that minimizes risk
- out definiton of risk
- volatility
- stadard deviation of daily returns 

- other measures of risk
- drawdown
- probablity of drawdown

- Harry Markowitz
- Mean Variance Optimization
- 1990 Nobel Prize
- You can build a portfolio that has lower risk than any of it's constituents

*** Input and Outputs of a Portfolio Optimzer
- Imputs
- Expected return for each Equity
- Volatility (risk) for each equity
- Target return
- Covariance matrix
  - For each equity how does it vary with the others

- Output
- Portfolio weights that minimize risk for tarket return

*** Importance of Correlation and Covariance
- Correlation between equities
- Portfolio is a weighted combination of equities

- Look at the correlation in daily returns
- 

Lookup Correlation and Covariance (on Wikipedia, similar Math)

Correlation varies between -1 to 1. 1 means they move together, -1 opposite., 0 is random

You can get a return graph that is 'straighter' by blending equities that are not-correlated
This is a lower risk solution

** The Efficient Frontier
*** The Efficient Frontier
- At different return values graphed you'll get a curve
- This curve is the efficient frontier
- One point has the highest return
  - This is the point with one equity with the highest return
- Another point has the lowest risk
  - Similary, the lower risk is the portfolio with the single equity with the lowest risk

- The 'best' is between

*** How Optimizers Work
- See QSTK_Tutorial_8
- /Users/brad/work/QSTK/Examples/Basic/tutorial8.py


- Assume that the optimzation function is convex
- Means there is only one peak

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_optimization

- QSTK uses CVXOPT
- An open source optimizer

** Quiz - Preparation
** Quiz - Event Studies

- Create a version of the Event Profiler that scans all stockes in a given list to discover events relating to "actual_close"
- Examine period Jan 1, 2008 to Dec 31, 2009
- Two data sets:
  - sp5002008.txt
  - sp5002012.txt

- Changes to Event Profiler
- Note: actual_close
- Event: when actual_close goes below 5.0

- Look in 2008 and 2012 and observe the differences
